+ `2022-09-26` I am currently reading through the Mushoku Tensei Light Novel Series. I am now at [volume 18](https://g.co/kgs/SS4fm1) of the official English-translated light novels.

+ `2022-08-15` The start of the 1st semester of academic year 2022â€“2023, and the 1st semester of my 4th year studying Chemical Engineering. It seems like things are ramping up and everyone seems eager for the face-to-face hybrid classes.

+ `2022-07-08` I participated as a semi-finalist in the [SCG Bangkok Business Challenge @ Sasin 2022](https://bbc.sasin.edu/2022) at Bangkok, Thailand. I also presented at the [60-second pitch round (01:35:35)](https://fb.watch/ehcWDuPn5L/) for the Opening Reception.
