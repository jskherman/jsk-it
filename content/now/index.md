+ `2022-11-28` Doing some improvements to my `streamlit` app for personal statistics/dashboard (something like the idea behind [Exist.io](https://exist.io/) but I get to build it myself from scratch). Have made progress integrating my [Todoist](https://todoist.com) tasks, [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

+ `2022-08-15` The start of the 1st semester of academic year 2022â€“2023, and the 1st semester of my 4th year studying Chemical Engineering. It seems like things are ramping up and everyone seems eager for the face-to-face hybrid classes.

## Reading Now

+ `2022-11-15` I am reading Ryan Holiday's book "[Ego is the Enemy](https://g.co/kgs/dv44rZ)". So far after glancing at the table of contents and the first few pages, it seems it would be an interesting read.

+ `2022-11-05` I am reading through the **Mushoku Tensei** Light Novel Series. I am now at [volume 19](https://g.co/kgs/SS4fm1) of the official English-translated light novels.
