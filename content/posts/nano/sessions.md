{{< admonition type=tip title="Question" open=true >}}
**Problem**: How do I replicate the **[Saved Sessions](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/tabs/session-management/)** feature in the Vivaldi browser and make it not a hassle to use?

{{< admonition type=success title="Answer" open=true >}}
**Solution**: Meet the extension **[Tabox](https://www.tabox.co/)**.
{{< /admonition >}}

I only discovered this extension recently after looking for ways to replicate the useful feature of sessions in Vivaldi.

I make extensive use of the Sessions feature in order to separate different workspaces, projects, and tasks that I have to do with the browser such as communications, research (this one particularly spawns a ***lot*** of tabs), and documentation diving (hello Google and StackOverflow).

Previously, without this extension I have been making use of the built-in collections feature of Microsoft Edge which to some extent has functioned for me as a replacement (but unfortunately cannot save PDF tabs).

Thus, I was delighted to know that this extension can help bring that to Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. The extension is simple and straight-forward to use, no sign-ups, no notes, no tasks, and no other unnecessary features. Focused and effective. Bonus: it can also keep track of *tab groups*. Nice.

Personally, I like using Microsoft Edge (despite privacy concerns) because of the rock solid PDF viewer with its highlight support and seamless integration with Windows (startup boost and downloads management particularly). With the arrival of the sidebar using the browser became much more appealing if you turn off some of the *more annoying* features.

Although I have to compensate with extensions, I find that my workflow seems to be unimpeded even after switching browsers. As a student having good performance and a decent feature set would be enough.
